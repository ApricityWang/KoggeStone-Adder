# KoggeStone-Adder
The Kogge-Stone algorithm is a form of a parallel prefix carry look-ahead adder which has a low fan-out at each stage, making it more performant in typical CMOS process nodes. This particular implementation is a 32-bit KSA written in Verilog, and is released subject to the terms of the MIT License which can be found in this distribution of the Verilog code in a file called LICENSE.
